## What This Is, Why It Exists and How This Helps	
This is a user guide so you can learn more about my personality, how to interpret my actions and the best way to interact with me.

## Who am I ?
Architect - https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality

* I believe in the servant-leader model as well as [extreme ownership](https://www.leaneast.com/extreme-ownership). As such when things go wrong I look at what I can do differently.
* Emotionally, I never get too high, or too low. A strength is I never have 'hair-on-fire' moments.
* I value communication more than most technical leaders. It something I continue to work to refine for myself and promote among my team.
* I have a tendency to organize things whether it be documentation or work. I have systems to help me manage my day such as using timeblocks as reminders/to-do's so I stay on top of things.
* I'll agree to get something done even if I don't know how and figure it out. It forces me to dive deep and learn.

## How I Interact with the World	

### Communication Methods
>  The why, how, and what of communication. What methods do you use to communicate, how do they change based on context or the person/group, and how often is each used? Example: ‚ÄúI always use the phone for any important interaction with my family but never with friends or co-workers.‚Äù Get specific about your strengths and challenges. 

I like documentation and notes to refer to. I work asyncronously where possible but for complex topics that require multiple perspectives prefer meeting. This is to reduce context switching as studies show it takes up to 15 mins to get reacquainted with a topic. Slack is great for items that don't need a detailed response and I am getting better at using reminders/tasks to come back to more detailed items when I have time.

### Authority Figures
>  Explain your approach to dealing with authority and how it will be received depending on the person (e.g., mom, police, boss, etc.). 

I like to work autonomously and interact best with those that provide a framework, guidelines or acceptance criteria for me to execute on. 



### Honoring Traditions and Messing with the Status Quo
>  Do your values come from honoring traditions or messing with the status quo? What are your values and important traditions (individual, family, business, cultural, religious, etc.) and how do you celebrate them?

I respect tradition but tend to challenge assumptions or ways of doing things if it doesn't make sense to me. I believe in doing the right thing and helping others - I will often take on my work myself if it saves the collective more time.

### Handling Stress
>  Stress can be subtle, brutal, motivating, incapacitating, and everything in between. Think about what the triggers of your main stress points are and how you manage them. How would you like to manage them in the future?

I don't get stressed easily as a result of work and have learned how to decompress in a healthy fashion(Rock Climbing, etc). I've been told I can handle difficult customers as well and stay calm but as an empathetic person I do pick up on others anxiety.

### Free Time
>  Your general approach to free time (e.g. fast paced or slow, structured or unstructured). 

Structured - Usually busy till an hour before bed and then read or watch tv. Have established routines that work for me from waking up/going to be at the same time and staying consistent in terms of meals/gym/activities with my family.

### Preferred Learning Method(s)
>  How do you prefer to learn (e.g. listening and reflecting, visually, experiencing and immediately doing, etc.)? 

Doing->Reading->Visually->Listening and Reflecting.

## Belief Systems and Blueprints	

### Labels and Phrases That Define You
>  If you could only use one word or a simple phrase to label yourself, what would they be? Multiple labels or phrases are encouraged (e.g. religious affiliation, how you analyze your thoughts, movements, or philosophies you believe in).

Driven
Innovative
Collaborative
Empathetic
Continuous learner
Stoic

### How I Express Myself

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Physically | I use a standing desk with a stool so you might see me move around. I can be both focused on a task at hand to get results or pivot to more relaxed modes of working to build relationships. |
| Emotionally | I don't tend to get stressed, worry or angry. If it does happen I can speak sternly - it was referred to as my "dad" voice. |
| Spiritually |  Agnostic |
| Intellectually |  I like to read, debate and learn. I was a philosophy major(ethics, religion, logic) but these days I read work related books on technology, communication and leadership as well as books for "fun". |

### What I Care Passionately About
>  The ideas or causes that energize and drive you.  Really dig into why you‚Äôre passionate about them. 
My kids. Solving problems. Improving things a little each day.




## The Role of My Relationships	
>  Some relationships are more important than others. What role does each relationship play and how significant is it?

## The ‚ÄúDo‚Äùs and ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt‚Äùs of Communicating with Me	
## My Schedule	
* I tend to wake up early(4-5am) which I used as time to learn. 
* I start work at 7am and log off 4-5pm most days.
* Offhours - best way to reach me is via text @ 860-944-9466

## How to Make Me Feel or Act 
## Goals and Areas of Growth	
* I come from a non-traditional data and analytics background. I studied Philosophy in college and got a data and analytics job for my first role out of college. Since then I've continued to develop my skillset on the job as well as by reading books on fundamentals/best practices and getting my masters in Business Analytics.

## Things I Like to Do and Why	

* I am a continual learner and enjoy diving into new technologies or domains whether it be in the data/analytics space or on other topics like communication and leadership.
* Outside of work I love rock climbing, reading, and spending time with my family.
* I type too fast and make spelling/grammatical mistakes where there isn't a native spell checker. I'm working on it. üòÅ
## When Trouble Occurs	
I try to understand the background on the issue, urgency(does it really need to be done today?), and options to move forward.
