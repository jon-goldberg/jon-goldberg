# Jon Goldberg

## **User Guide**

A field guide for understanding and interacting with Jon Goldberg. 


## **Preferred Working Style** üëã
* I am a continual learner and enjoy diving into new technologies or domains whether it be in the data/analytics space or on other topics like communication and leadership.
* I believe in the servant-leader model as well as extreme ownership.
* Emotionally, I never get too high, or too low. A strength is I never have 'hair-on-fire' moments.
* I value communication more than most engineering leaders. It something I continue to work to refine for myself and promote among my team.
* I quickly triage and organize requests using timeblocks as reminders/to-do's so I stay on top of things.
* If I commit to something I'll get it done.
* I come from a non-traditional data and analytics background. I studied Philosophy in college and got a data and analytics job for my first role out of college. Since then I've continued to develop my skillset on the job as well as by reading books on fundamentals/best practices and getting my masters in Business Analytics.
* Outside of work I love rock climbing, reading, and spending time with my family.
* I type too fast and make spelling/grammatical mistakes where there isn't a native spell checker. I'm working on it. üòÅ

## How I Interact with the World	

### Communication Methods
<sub> The why, how, and what of communication. What methods do you use to communicate, how do they change based on context or the person/group, and how often is each used? Example: ‚ÄúI always use the phone for any important interaction with my family but never with friends or co-workers.‚Äù Get specific about your strengths and challenges. </sub>


### Authority Figures
<sub> Explain your approach to dealing with authority and how it will be received depending on the person (e.g., mom, police, boss, etc.). </sub>

### Honoring Traditions and Messing with the Status Quo
<sub> Do your values come from honoring traditions or messing with the status quo? What are your values and important traditions (individual, family, business, cultural, religious, etc.) and how do you celebrate them?</sub>


### Handling Stress
<sub> Stress can be subtle, brutal, motivating, incapacitating, and everything in between. Think about what the triggers of your main stress points are and how you manage them. How would you like to manage them in the future?</sub>

### Free Time
<sub> Your general approach to free time (e.g. fast paced or slow, structured or unstructured). </sub>

### Preferred Learning Method(s)
<sub> How do you prefer to learn (e.g. listening and reflecting, visually, experiencing and immediately doing, etc.)? </sub>

## Belief Systems and Blueprints	

### Labels and Phrases That Define You
If you could only use one word or a simple phrase to label yourself, what would they be? Multiple labels or phrases are encouraged (e.g. religious affiliation, how you analyze your thoughts, movements, or philosophies you believe in).

### How I Express Myself
Physically
I wave my hands a lot. My body language reflects more about my mood than my voice sometimes.
Emotionally
I am very stable emotionally. I don‚Äôt have ups and downs; very even keeled. If I am upset, you‚Äôll see it in my body language before you hear it in my voice, because the more upset I am, the calmer I tend to sound. However, I won‚Äôt be smiling or have any cheerful body language. Most of my body language will cease to be expressive.
Spiritually
 I am not religious or spiritual at this point in my life.
Intellectually
 I absolutely love intellectual conversation. By that I mean the exchange of ideas; and I do so passionately. Topics include (but not limited to) System Architecture and Design, Philosophy in general, Ethics, Technology. I dislike conversations that are purely opinion based, like Politics.
Other (Specify)

### What I Care Passionately About
The ideas or causes that energize and drive you.  Really dig into why you‚Äôre passionate about them. 





## The Role of My Relationships	
Some relationships are more important than others. What role does each relationship play and how significant is it?

### **My API**

What follows is a human-readable document for how to best interact with me.

An [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) is formal specification for how computer programs talk to each other, usually for the purpose of communicating or processing data. Similarly, you might consider this a semi-formal specification on how to best interact with me, and what to expect when you do.

#### **Meetings**

As I wrote the first draft of the company's meeting page in Flipbook, my approach is generally captured [there]({{&lt;ref "meetings">}}).

One addendum: I'm a big fan of meeting pre-reads. That is, work to be done _prior_ to participants entering a meeting. In general, I find "brainstorming" meetings more effective if they are discussions about thoughts previously articulated rather than done live. (There extensive research [suggesting](https://hbr.org/2017/05/your-team-is-brainstorming-all-wrong) this is a better approach all-around.)


### **How should I reach out?**



### **Communications Style**

I am direct, often to a fault, and tend to dispense niceties in favor of getting down to business. This _does not mean_ that I don't care about who I'm speaking with or want to know how things are going. (I very much do, in fact!) More precisely, I'm very much focused on ideas, behaviors, and what's next and often forget to ask, "How are you?"

On that, I am a non-reactive active listener. I try to focus on what people are telling me and tend to wait to absorb and digest information before responding, _especially_ if it's important. Throughout my life I've received feedback that this can make me "difficult to read". Despite this, I am a squarely average poker player.

I tend to repeat myself. I do this in an attempt to be consistent in my messaging, and to ensure that the message is getting through. If I'm repeating myself to the point of annoyance, do point this out as it'll signal to me that you've got the message. (I'm still going to repeat myself, but less frequently.) If I contradict myself, point that out too. I may have changed my position and forgot to tell you. (Sorry!)

I often choose $10 words when 30¬¢ ones will do. (Verily, eschewing grandiose verbiage remains a challen‚Äî ahem... er, uh I mean to say, "I'm working on it.")


### **System of Record**

Given my role, my principle System of Record is stratified across my team's Systems of Record. To understand my objectives and priorities, I maintain OKRs for the Tech Team and, of course, Flipbook as our knowledge management system and index.


## **Work Philosophies and Style**

My work demeanor hews advisor, teacher, and coach.


### **Decisions**

Decisions should be made at the commensurate level of responsibility and ownership.

For my part, I tend to decide at the last _responsible_ moment. Sometimes it's also the last _possible_ moment, but not often. I don't subscribe to any specific decision-making framework, but I find they all have their uses.

My decisions often include a tacit confidence interval. Depending on how new information affects that confidence, decisions may be revised. This happens rarely. I am (almost) always happy to unpack a decision upon request, assuming I've neglected to proactively do so.


## **Professional Characteristics**

What I bring to the table.


### **Professional Values**



* Integrity. Internalize and exhibit strong principles, ethics, consistency, and accountability.
* Ownership. Assume responsibility; know that decisions and actions affect others. Own those consequences.
* Outcome-oriented: Drive outcomes over activity. (Although, deliberate action follow-through is often required!)
* Data-driven. Live an evidence-based lifestyle. (I borrowed this phrase from my wife.)
* Transparency. Operate in the open. (Sunlight is the best disinfectant.)
* Growth. Seek abundance. See also: _[Developing a Growth Mindset - Dweck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiEeMN7vbQ)_
