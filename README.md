👀 Here are some things about me:

* I am a continual learner and enjoy diving into new technologies or domains whether it be in the data/analytics space or on other topics like communication and leadership.
* I believe in the servant-leader model as well as extreme ownership.
* Emotionally, I never get too high, or too low. A strength is I never have 'hair-on-fire' moments.
* I value communication more than most engineering leaders. It something I continue to work to refine for myself and promote among my team.
* I quickly triage and organize requests using timeblocks as reminders/to-do's so I stay on top of things.
* If I commit to something I'll get it done.
* I come from a non-traditional data and analytics background. I studied Philosophy in college and got a data and analytics job for my first role out of college. Since then I've continued to develop my skillset on the job as well as by reading books on fundamentals/best practices and getting my masters in Business Analytics.
* Outside of work I love rock climbing, reading, and spending time with my family.
* I type too fast and make spelling/grammatical mistakes where there isn't a native spell checker. I'm working on it. 😁
